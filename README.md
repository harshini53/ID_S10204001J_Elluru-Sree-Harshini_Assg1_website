Design Process

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

This portfolio is my future employees 

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

    As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
