            <h2>Introduction</h2>           
            <p>
                My name is Harshini. I am currently a 1st-year student at Ngee Ann pursuing a diploma in Information 
                Technology. Ever since young I have been fascinated by technology and how it keeps evolving. It 
                amazes me how these small devices (phones) has so many applications and uses such as for entertainment 
                (play games and watching YouTube) or for research (School Projects). Due to that I have always been 
                fascinated by it and decided to pursue web applications as I find it amazing to create apps and have them 
                be used by many people. The curriculum in Ngee Ann is aligned with my goals of being a web developer and 
                also be a well - rounded tech professional. Thus I came to Ngee Ann.

                <p>
                    Ever since young, drawing has been a fun thing for me to do and acts as a stress-reliver when 
                    work becomes unbearable. It just started with small random doodles until I started to take it 
                    more seriously by practicing and eventually became a bit better. I mainly shade and draw as its 
                    easier compared to painting and coloring. I am trying to improve my skills by trying new things 
                    like portraits as I can currently only can draw characters, animals and not portraits.

                <p>
                    I like to play badminton during my free time as it’s easy to play and can play anywhere. It helps 
                    me to have fun and also help keep a more active lifestyle as I mostly live a sedentary life other 
                    than travelling to school. I mostly play together with my sister of friends.
