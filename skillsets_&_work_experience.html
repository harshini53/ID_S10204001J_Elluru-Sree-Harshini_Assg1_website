                <p>Time Management</p>
                <p class="text">
                  I have good time management skills.I do it by finishing my work first before focusing 
                  on my hobbies. This is because I do not want to be rushing my work last minute and give
                  poor quality work. Moreover, I will be less stressed as the deadline approaches.

                <p class="text">
                  In secondary school, I was in the Girls Brigade where I was part of the Non-commissioned 
                  council officers (NCO) where we had to plan activities weekly. Through that year, I learnt 
                  how to plan the different activities and the budgets for them, submit the proposal and 
                  lastly organise the activities with my fellow teammates.

                  As you have seen me under work experience, I have taken many different jobs. Through this, 
                  I have gained experience and adaptability skills such as communicating with different types
                  of people. Moreover, I  gained experience in doing a variety of jobs such as warehouse,
                  retail and the food industry.

                <p class="text">
                  In my Year 1 Semester 1, I learnt Python in school. In these six months, we were thought the 
                  basics of python and how it can be used in real-life applications. For our final assignment, 
                  we were tasked to create a certain game. I found it quite challenging at first. However, 
                  I managed to understand the task and submitted my program.

                <p class="text">
                  I have learnt HTML and CSS from school and have done projects regarding it such as creating a 
                  website for tourists visiting Singapore. The whole process of creating the website was fun and 
                  it was most satisfying to see the code lines turn into a beautiful website?

                  In one of my modules, we had learnt how to use adobe illustrator. From there, I had 
                  self-learnt during my free time as I wanted to use it to do animated art.
